# <JAVASCRIPT PASSWORD GENERATOR>

## Description

 My task was to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
 

### Why did you build this project?
To practice javascript, i had/have little exp coding. i found this exercise to help understand how functions work together. how to set boolean's, varaibles, if , if else, and for-loops. 

### What problem does it solve?
how to set global and local var. 
set-up functions that run only when called. 
that also validates user inputs.
use for-loop to add charaters randomly using (Math.random) from my global array's set to password length from user input.
